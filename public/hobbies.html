        <h3>Programing</h3>
       
        Currently, I try to spent 5 hr a week on Programing.
        My current job takes some physical strength,
        I like to do something with less body effort, more about brain in my free time.

        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        if I experienced or learned something I like to remember, 
        and I can not picture that at the moment. 
        I would try to draw it down. 
        Currently, most the topic is about horse and time with friends.<picture></picture>

<h2>Things I like to do before</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Snowboarding</h3>
        I spent quite energy to learn snowboarding.
        And I get a entry level snowboard certification.
        The certification show that I know a well-constructed method to teach people who never do snowboarding before.

    <li><h3>Gymnastics</h3>
    I start to do gymnastics after I start to work.
    And learn it about 2 years. I can do back flip, front flip and side flip in the gym.
    Now I am not sure.üòÜ

    <li><h3>Flowrider</h3>
    During the COVID-19, I can not do snowboarding in Japan.
    However, I still want to do something to maintain my Skills.
    I do surfing, and skateboad sometime. they are fun, but quite different from snowboard.
    Somehow, a flowrider shop open for business. So I decide to give it a try.
    I spent about 50 hours in the shop. 
    The staff said I probally the best customer who can ride the non-dominant position.

</ol>
Those activitis cost a lot of time, energy and money.
I am not sure when will I do the them next time.
A vocation and an invitation from my friends would be neccessary.üòÅ
